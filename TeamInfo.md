## Project Summary
Synapo is a social networking and chat platform designed to make finding friends and building communities easier. By connecting users based on shared interests, the platform ensures that people interact with others who have similar preferences, reducing the uncertainty that comes with meeting new people.

Users can engage in one-on-one conversations or join interest-based groups for socializing, networking, and collaboration. This structured approach provides some level of assurance that new connections will be relevant, making it easier to integrate into a new environment. Beyond casual conversations, the platform can also be used to form teams for hackathons, projects, or sports events by leveraging its backend for group coordination and event planning.
